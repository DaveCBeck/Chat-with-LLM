# Chat-with-LLM
Work in progress - I would not advise using this yet.

Finished stack will be based on Next.js, Langchain, Chroma and Zep for chat with LLMs including RAG and message search/persistence.
 
For now I'll use Vercel KV in place of Zep, until langchain memory integration is enabled for runnables.

### Note-to-self
To bring in updates from Vercel's AI chatbot template, which is still in development:
git fetch NextUI main
git subtree pull --prefix frontend NextUI main
(and then merge changes)
